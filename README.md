# GrafanaAgents

This repo is dedicated to keeping a collection of common configs for Grafana Agents.


All files in here have been tested to work in Binary Installs of Grafana Agents, and Installs in Kubernetes.

My workflow is as follows.

Build initial config on my development vm(Ubuntu Server 22.04LTS) install Grafana Agent, Build Config, Do Testing.

Once satisfied i convert the configs to flow mode, and then implement them in Kubernetes.
